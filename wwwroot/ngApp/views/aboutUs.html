        <h3>Aspiring Code Ninja (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drew-bronnenkant/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>)</h3>
        <p>I'm a Phoenix native who recently sold his locksmith business to get into web development. I'm an ASU graduate with
            a degree in psychology and communication. I have a passion for technology and security and I love learning new
            things. My favorite hobbies include working out, playing guitar, and listening to punk rock. I am truly lucky
            to be a part of this team and I look forward to more projects in the future! Email me at <a href="mailto:drew@wanderdragon.com?Subject=Hi%20Drew"

        <h3>Full Stack .NET Web Developer
            (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-antila/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>)</h3>
        <p>Born and raised in Phoenix, undergrad in North Carolina (Go Duke). Curious. Explorer. Guacamole and craft beer afecianado. Former soccer player. Rescue dog parent. I wasn't like every other kid, you know, who dreams about being an astronaut, 
                I was always more interested in what bark was made out of on a tree. Richard Gere's a real hero of mine. Sting. Sting would be another person who's a hero.
                The music he's created over the years, I don't really listen to it, but the fact that he's making it, I respect that. I care desperately about what I do. Do I know what product I'm selling? No. Do I know what I'm doing today? 
                No. But I'm here, and I'm gonna give it my best shot.</p>

        <p>I'm an avid ecologist and goldfish (AND betta fish) champion. A recent graduate from UC Davis, I spend my spare time
            drawing and learning to code some more. My ultimate goal in life is to have a dog. Pictured above is me carrying
            out some fieldwork along the coast of California and some weird girl hoisting me by the tail.</p>
